Okay, so I've found a local butcher. He (and his family) have been working in this area for 40+ years. Their prices are a *bit* more than other local markets but their quality is *much* higher. My preference is to put my business into local businesses provided the product and/or service warrants the patronage.

Well, they had a sale on chicken wings this week so...I'm going to be eating a lot of chicken wings.
