Well, I've done it. I've decided to switch to a keto (ketogenic) diet. There are a number of reasons for this change but the main reasons are pretty stereotypical of most diet adoptions. Namely, healthier eating and weight loss. Keto, like many other diets, has a host of ancillary health benefit assertions associated with it. However, none of these drove me to adopt this diet. Nope. My impetus was _much_ simpler.

You see, about 10 months ago I was feeling particularly poorly so I went off to the doctor and had my food sensitivities tested. Turns out that more-or-less the majority of items I liked to eat,well, I was sensitive to. No wonder I felt terrible! Here's a list of the "heavy hitters", the things I am most sensitive to and so should exclude from my diet as much as is possible:

No-No Foods | Guilty by Association | Saboteur Examples
--- | --- | ---
Bran | Wheat bran | Processed cereals with added fiber
Cinnamon | Cinnamon oil, cinnamon tea, powdered spice, sticks | Baked goods, Mincemeat, pumpkin pie spice
Clam | All forms, Mussels, raw or cooked, freshwater and saltwater, frozen | Seafood chowder, seafood stuffing
Egg (chicken) | Egg and egg parts in all forms | So many (just think about it)
Ginger | All forms, authentic ginger ale, ginger beer and wine, ginger root, ginger tea | Baked goods, dietary supplements, herbal teas, candy
Malt | All forms, barley malt, malt vinegar, malted shakes | Hot beverages, baked goods, cereals, confectionary
Mushroom | All varieties, all forms, mushroom extract | Vegetarian oyster sauce
Oats | All forms, granola, muesli, gluten-free oats, oat bran, oat flour, oat milk | Baked goods, cereals
Pineapple | All forms | Shakes, confectionary, fruit salads, marinades
Safflower | Safflower oil | Mayonnaise, tartar sauce, cookies, fried foods, nut butters, margarine, salad dressing
Yeast (Baker's) | | 
Yeast (Brewer's) | 

Now, add to that the food allergies I already knew about, namely:

* Peanuts
* Cashews
* Brazil nuts

The list of things that hurt me (those last three fatally so) and while not super restrictive I knew that without a plan I'd feel poorly.

Enter Keto.

As of this date Keto is a goal, not an achievement but I'll be planning out my week's worth of meals (with each week's plan starting on Sunday), taking walks each day, counting macros and calories, and hydrating thoroughly.

Specifically I'm planning to ~1500 calories per day with a macro breakdown roughly along the lines of:

* 70% fat
* 25% protein
* 5% carbohydrates (net)

I had intended to track this in a private github repository, but that method doesn't easily let me share with those of you who might be interested...so, best of both worlds! I'm still going to put everything in github but I'll use github pages to make a decent frontend that anyone can access.
